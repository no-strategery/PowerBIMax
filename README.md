# PowerBIMax

The goal of this project is to create an extension that can maximize the
Power BI dashboard view so that it can fill the screen as much as possible
and be used for digital signage applications.

It should take a URL to monitor (URL of your Power BI dashboard), and once
the page loads, it should use xPath to "click" on the buttons required to
expand the view of the dashboard.
